# à¶¯à·’à¶»à·’ (Diri) - CKD Financial Aid Expert System ðŸŒŸ

## Overview

à¶¯à·’à¶»à·’ (Diri) is an innovative Streamlit-based expert system designed to help Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients navigate and access financial aid programs. The system provides a comprehensive workflow that assists patients in understanding their eligibility for various financial support initiatives.

### Key Features

- **Patient Information Processing**: Capture and analyze patient details
- **Eligibility Analysis**: Determine financial aid program eligibility
- **Application Generation**: Automatically generate tailored financial aid applications
- **Interactive User Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit web application
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Dynamic knowledge management using Prolog

## System Workflow

The expert system follows a structured three-step approach:

1. **Patient Information Input**
   - Enter comprehensive patient description
   - Extract key patient details
   - Initialize patient profile

2. **Eligibility Analysis**
   - Check patient's eligibility for financial aid programs
   - List eligible and non-eligible programs
   - Provide detailed eligibility explanations

3. **Application Generation**
   - Generate customized financial aid applications
   - Streamline the application process for CKD patients

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
